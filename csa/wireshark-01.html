            BYU-I CSA WireShark PCap Activity
        </h2>
        <p class="left">
            Below is a list of things you will need to participate in this activity:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="left">WireShark (the download page for the latest version of WireShark is located <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">here</a>)</li>
            <li class="left">An internet connection (which you should have if you're reading this...)</li>
            <li class="left">The desire to have fun</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="left">
            Here's how we'll begin:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="left">Make sure WireShark is installed</li>
            <li class="left">Run WireShark and start capturing packet data on your computer (if you need help with this part, I suggest you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X5TwvGXHP0">this clip</a>)</li>
            <li class="left">While capturing packet data, visit this <a href="wireshark-02.html">weather gallery</a></li>
            <li class="left">We have reason to believe the BYU-I CSA has hidden login information in this page to send to a new user. Use WireShark to analyze the data sent and recieved from the weather gallery page to see if you can spot anything to help you login to the Top Secret Database for the BYU-I CSA. Hurry before they remove the page from use!</li>
            <li class="left">Once you think you've found the username and password, go to the login page for the BYU-I CSA Top Secret Database located <a href="tslogin.html">here</a></li>
       </ol>
